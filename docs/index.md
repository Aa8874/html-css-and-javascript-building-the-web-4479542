# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Building the Web

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Building the Web. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Quickstart

This repository is instrumented with a _`devcontainer.json`_ that provides a pre-defined development environment for this course. To get started:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account, to get an editable version.
1. Click the `Code` dropdown in your forked version in the browser.
1. Select the `Codespaces` tab and create a new GitHub Codespaces instance from `main`.

You should see a new GitHub Codespaces session launch in a new browser tab with a built-in Visual Studio Code editor for interactive development. Wait till setup completes and a terminal prompt is seen.

Preview the instructions for the course exercises using this command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

## Project Solutions

This LinkedIn course is based on a subset of the materials available in the [Web Dev For Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/web-dev-for-beginners) curriculum from Microsoft. Please visit that repository to explore additional projects and exercises for self-guided learning.

In this LinkedIn course, we walk through three of the sample projects from that curriculum (replicated locally under `solutions/` for convenience) in a series of instructor-led videos. Read on for a brief description of each.

### Project 1: Terrarium

### Project 2: Typing Game

### Project 3: Space Game
